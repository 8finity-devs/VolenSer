      <h6 class="text-start my-1">
        Throughout our history, we’ve worked toward a single purpose:  engaging communities through volunteer action. VolenSer got its start when our founder realized that we could better serve our community by creating the best possible volunteer experience. For more than 5 years, our organization has seen succsfull stories .
        <br><br>
        When we were founded in 2016 , we had no idea that we could make this differnce to the public.
        <br><br>
        Over the years, the one thing that’s always stayed the same is the commitment and work jointly with the team .
        <br><br>
        Each year has been an opportunity to  grow.
        <br><br>
        Since our founding, the unwavering dedication of volunteers helped our mission come to life.
        <br><br>
        We wouldn’t be who we are today without  them and key milestones that shaped our programs and services.
